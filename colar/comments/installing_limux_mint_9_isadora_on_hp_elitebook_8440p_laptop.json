"text":"Hello,\nHave you been successful at installing Linux Mint 12 on your \nHP Elitebook 8440P? I have but not able to use it with second monitor and that is a game stopper for me. Just wondering. Your fixes/help for Mint 9 were great and work wonderfully. Any help would be much appreciated for Mint 12.\nTom",
