"text":"Hi, first of all I am grateful for your efforts in getting something like this to work. \n\nI am currently in Ecuador and I am trying to get the app to work for Porta.\n\nI modified the chat file and the other file and I will paste the results below, but my problem seems to be before it even gets there. \n\nI am currently using a Blackberry Storm on Ubuntu 8.10 and I have installed Barry but never really used it. When I run the \"sudo python bbtether.py porta -v\" command, I get the following...\n\nLooking for USB devices:\n\tBus 007 Device 002: ID 0fca:8007\n\tBus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002\n\tBus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001\n\tBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001\n\tBus 003 Device 002: ID 04f2:b018\n\tBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002\n\tBus 002 Device 002: ID 147e:2016\n\tBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001\n\tBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001\n\tBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001\n\nIncreasing USB power - for charging\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"bbtether.py\", line 139, in <module>\n    BBTether()\n  File \"bbtether.py\", line 77, in __init__\n    bb_usb.set_bb_power(berry)\n  File \"/home/kotipelto/Downloads/bbtether/bb_usb.py\", line 143, in set_bb_power\n    device.handle.controlMsg(0x40, 0xA2, buffer, 0 , 1)\nusb.USBError: error sending control message: Broken pipe\n\n\nI modified the bb_usb.py file and changed the following entries:\n\nPRODUCT_NEW_9500=0x8007   #(Storm 9500) #line 15\n\nand\n\nif(berry.idProduct == PRODUCT_NEW_9500): #line 74\n\t\ttype=\"9500\" #line 75\n\nI still get the same exact problem, and I am not sure if what I changed is ok but I am trying :) (I have very little if any experience with programming)\n\nIn any regards, I was wondering if you could give me a hand with this and if there is anything else I can provide you with that may help you help me I will be glad to do so.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDaniel\n\n",
