===Camembert Lightweight IDE===

It support multiple project types such as Fantom, Maven, Python, Ruby, Nodejs, Axon and is a useful all around lightweight editor / IDE.

It has many features including rendering pages in Markdown, Dokuwiki or HTML syntax.

It is a partial port/rewrite of my previous Java blog engine called [[http://www.jotwiki.net/home|jotwiki]] which was implemented in java.

===MameChose M.A.M.E frontend===
[[http://wiki.colar.net/mamechose|MameChose]] is a Mame(Arcade game emulator) frontend.
It allows quick indexing / searching / launching of an arcade game collection(roms).
It is dsigned to have a simple but effective interface that is used only with a joystick and a few buttons.
The interface is also designed to scale so it can work as well on all arcade monitors(<320x260) as on latest LCD's with a high resolution.

  * [[https://bitbucket.org/tcolar/saptomcat|Sap Tomcat]]
Sap Tomcat is a bunch of work I did to allow to run the SAP B2B and B2C java applications
on a much lighter opensource stack of Tomcat or Jetty + MySql or H2 .
The standrad SAP web server can be extremely frustrating for development as it's extremely slow to redeploy an application.
This allowed greatly enhanced developer productivity as well as used of standard tooling (IDE, debuggers, profilers and so on).
