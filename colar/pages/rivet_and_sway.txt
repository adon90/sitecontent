======Rivet & Sway======

In April 2013 I joined [[http://rivetandsway.com | Rivet & Sway]], a cool young startup trying to disrupt the eye-ware <del>market</del> monopoly.

Here I'm going to be writing about being back at a start-up after a hiatus.

- [[Why a startup again]] ?
- [[why_rivet_and_sway | Why Rivet & Sway]] ?

=====What Am I working on=====
I am going to blog into much more details about all this soon, once I find the time.

Here are some things I had to work on so far:
- Migrate from our unreliable and expensive Drupal PAAS provider to a better solution (AWS)
- Scaling Drupal (Many steps to that, platform & software stack)
- Developer workflow tools for Drupal. (Implemented in GO)
- Researched alternatives to using Dropbox in the company setting
- Operational enhancements: As our order volume is growing rapidly it became important to optimize operations (Order processing, Shipping, EDI, inventory).
- Mobile optimization.
- Researching and specifying a new platform roadmap (Replace Drupal)
