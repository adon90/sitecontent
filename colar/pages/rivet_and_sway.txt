======Rivet & Sway======

I joined Rivet and Sway, a cool young startup in April 2013.

Here I'm going to be blogging about the start-up experience, not my first time, as well
as technological choices and E-commerce.

Here are my blog entries relevant to this:

  * Here is my background and why I'm back at a start-up once again.
- Startup's are fun - more impact
- large companies interview fail
- I like E-commerce
- Mode freedom
- Working from home / Own business

  * Why Rivet & way and why I'm excited about.

- Pantheon / drupal / cahing and all the issues that come with it
- paas reseach / nodejitsu
- aws and new setup
- dropbox / owncloud



- coursera
- learn to type
