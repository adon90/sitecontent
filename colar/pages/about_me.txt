====== About Me ======
Hello there, my name is Thibaut Colar.
I'm a software Developer.

I grew up in a tiny village in France but after college I moved to The SF bay area(1998) where all the interesting geek stuff was happening.
Since 2005 I've lived in the Seattle area with my wife and 2 kids.

My interests are software, startups, building things, playing and watching hockey, enjoying the outdoors and eating yummy stuff.

I currently work at a cool start-up named **[[http://www.rivetandsway.com|Rivet & Sway]]** in downtown Seattle.

In the past I have worked for [[http://www.qarbon.com|Qarbon.com]], [[http://www.pacificcoast.com|Pacific Coast Feather]] and [[http://www.teachscape.com|Teachscape]].

I also have my own consulting company [[http://www.status302.com | Status302 LLC]]
