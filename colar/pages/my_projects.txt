======Projects that I have built======
**Here are a few things (non-software) that I have built with my own hands over the years:**

I Built an oldschool arcade from plywood and an old imac Mini.
Also made my own UI frontend software for it.

  * [[Car Mp3 Player]] (2000-2002) .... **very** poor English, sorry.
About the MP3 car player I built way back in 2000, when nobody had one yet.
It even had a feature to "say" the current song artist/title using text 2 speech (robot voice).

  * [[MythTV PVR]] (2005)
My Tv recorder  (computer + TV), once again nothing special nowadays but not many people had one then.
