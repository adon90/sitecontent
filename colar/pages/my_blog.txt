======My Blogs======
I decided to split my blogs in several parts, since they have such different subjects.

  * [[Geek Blog]]
Here you will find a lot of software informations, such as tips, installation walkthrough and other discussion/opinion on various IT subjects.
This is mostly about Linux and Java related subjects (but also other things).

  * [[SAP tips]]
I work with SAP sofware at work, so here you will find a lot of informations about my experience with that: CRM 5.0, B2B, B2B, ISA, TREX etc...

  * [[Ice Hockey Blog]]
You will find informations and opinions about hockey, mostly the NHL in general and my favorite team, the San Jose Sharks.

  * [[Martial Arts Blog]]
I just (june 2007) decided to get back into martial arts (Tae Kwon Do) and you can read about my experience doing that here.

  * [[General Blog]]
My thought on any other subject, like things i saw in the news, and made me react vigorously.
