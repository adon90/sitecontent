"title":"Questions about fantom plugin",
"text":"First of all: thanks for your efforts, i am using the plugin for several days now and it works great. However i have a few questions about missing features:\n1) Auto indent is not working. Is this a bug or missing feature?\n2) It would be great to be able to run fantom tests from NB, just like the Java ones (ctrl-f6)\n3) Is a file type Fantom test planned? (create -> new -> Fantom test. Then the test file is created from a template and stored in the test directory)\n\nRegards,\n\nRonald",
